With the bootcamp behind me, no teachers to get help from, and no team-mates to ask questions to, could I still build a functioning website? And suddenly being entirely responsible for my progress, considering how much time, money and sacrifice I'd invested into the bootcamp, was a nerve-wracking thing. But it was a challenge I dived head first into, starting Plant as Usual that morning after the bootcamp finished. And although I struggled somewhat, as I expected to, two weeks later I emerged with a fully-functional Rails app, built off nothing but my own sweat and stress. But I did it.

Working over the full stack of the project, I was charged with creating the tools to allow our team of negotiators and property manager to handle all aspects of bringing on and managing properties; from rent payments to maintenance tickets to connecting energy suppliers to creating contracts and a whole lot more, I had a hand in all parts of the software we used. And in cutting my teeth here, I learned the importance of writing DRY, readable, specced code. Touching all elements on the backend and the front, I gained an expertise in Rails, Rspec, HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript and jquery, as well as significant time learning React and Redux. Brought to a premature conclusion by Coronavirus, having arrived at Rentify a novice Rails programmer, I left fully confident in my ability to code in Rails to a level far higher than someone with my experience should be able to.", site_url: 'https://www.rentify.com', github_url: null },

Now with the experience to do it better than I had before, I decided to rewrite my first post-bootcamp project from the ground up. My experience to this point had taught me errors that even the most experienced developers make, and I wanted to make an app that avoided them. I wanted the code to be clean, DRY and easily-readable, I wanted every method to be specced, and I wanted a foundation built so that I could be confident that changing one thing, wouldn't break something else. A simple styling example being that you should be able to resize elements without concerning yourself about resizing others to fit them. With <a href='https://github.com/jro31/Plant-as-Usual-2/blob/979437e6b6470dea5684d1f5300c581016c62443/app/assets/stylesheets/config/_sizes.sass#L24' target='_blank'>the navbar</a> for example, all positions and widths are calculated from base values. So if you want to change the navbar height, go ahead. The rest of the elements will resize accordingly. Styling is the most simple of examples I could give, but it translated to all parts of the app, where no code was duplicated, so you could know that changing something in one place would be sufficient. Using this philosophy, the site's features include dark mode and an ajax-powered recipe page where you can update all parts of a recipe including the ingredients and photo, without leaving the show page. An ambitious but ultimately successful reimagination of how you can create a recipe, on an app with large growth potential and many more features to come.", site_url: 'https://www.plantasusual.com', github_url: 'https://github.com/jro31/Plant-as-Usual-2' }
